- data/ - Stores employee records and generated payroll reports
- docs/ - Folder contains all project-related documentation:
  - UML - visual representation and design patterns
  - User Documentation - User manual with instructions and screenshots
  - Test Log - Logs of unit test runs
  - Screenshots - Images showing the functionality, error messages, or test results

Features:
- GUI using Tkinter
- Payroll calculations based on employee data
- Organized and modular code structure
- Error handling for user input

Requirements:
- Python 3.12 or newer

How to Run the Program:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Run the following command:
'''bash
python main.py


Design Overview:
This application uses a modular design by separating the user interface, payroll logic, and utility functions into different modules. This structure makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and update as the project grows.
